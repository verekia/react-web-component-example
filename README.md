# React Web Component Example

This is simply a counter coded in React, compiled with Webpack (9kb uncompressed, 3kb gzipped), with React as an external dependency, and consumed via a custom element `<x-counter>`.

Note: More work would need to be done to make such custom element SEO-friendly, such as using `<slot>`.

I also don't know how Facebook's Open Graph bot or Twitter's Cards bot would handle those.
